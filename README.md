# What's this ?

Kotlin eye tracking sample app using OpenCV library

Look left or right to move the circle

This app is not working very well actually and not optimized at all

Just created as a POC, feel free to reuse and improve :)

# Requirements

- OpenCV Manager installed on device : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine&hl=en
- Camera permission
